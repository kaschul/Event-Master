//to test this login route through postman, run the server side first. npm start. in postman use the POST instead of 'get' and type in {{Url}}/api/users.login. then one row below, choose body bc that is the data of the user we are posting. then choose raw, and then in dropdown to right, choose json. below write: { "email": "matthew@myshop.com", "password": "3453453"} will recieve a token(encrypted text from id ). components are in html. we want to make sure all  post data that we recueve is in form of a json. in server.js when express gets data convert it into json using app.use(express.json())
